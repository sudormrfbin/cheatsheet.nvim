Some commands\nrequire a register or mark or number before them, and they are marked\nwith `{r}`, `{m}`, `{n}`, etc. These are not hard and fast rules, simply\nconventions -- you can of course ignore them when writing your own cheats.\n\nOne point of interest is that of commands: when pressing enter from the\nTelescope UI, if the current selection is a command, it will be filled\nin the command line like you have typed it (it won't be executed yet).\nNote that it will *stop* filling the command line when it encounters a `{`\nor `[`. So if the cheat is `:set textwidth={n}`, your commandline will\nhave `:set textwidth=` typed into it and the cursor at end. Pretty neat eh ;)","files":null}]}
